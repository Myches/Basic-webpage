                Hello, my name is Michael Ebo Andorful. I'm a self-taught front-end developer.
                I've come very far in my tech journey as a beginner developer and
                in the next two years, my goal is to become a well-rounded and in-demand frontend developer. Here is my roadmap:<br />
                Master a Modern Framework: I'll take a deep dive into a popular framework such as React, Vue.js, or Angular, learning how to create rich and engaging user interfaces.<br />
                Performance Pro: My primary focus will be on optimizing website performance and responsiveness, enabling seamless user experiences across all devices.<br />
                Beyond the Basics: I'll gain a thorough understanding of advanced CSS methods such as preprocessors and animations, allowing me to create visually attractive and dynamic interfaces.<br />
                Open Source Contribution: I plan to contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with other developers, learn best practices, and build my portfolio.<br />
                Communication : I will improve my soft skills, particularly communication and collaboration, in order to work effectively with designers and backend developers.<br />
                Through continual study and application With these abilities, I hope to become a useful asset in any frontend development team within the next two years.
