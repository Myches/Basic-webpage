                Hello, my name is Michael Ebo Andorful. I'm a self-taught front-end developer.
                I specialize in creating user interfaces and web apps with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
                With a strong desire to create  visually beautiful web apps, I strive to provide high-quality code and interesting user experiences.
                I've come very far in my tech journey as a beginner developer and
                in the next two years one of my main objective is to continue to master my frontend prowess by contributing to open source 
                ,staying updated with emerging technologies and also seek an internship role to gain practical hands on industry experience.
                Again I would also like to learn another programming language , particularly Python or Java.My overall aim is to transition from a frontend developer into a full-stack developer
                hence the need to learn a backend programming language.My goal is to continue to grow slowly and steadily in the tech ecosystem , gaining valuable skills to help me acheive my overall career objective.
                The next two years are going to be tremendous. With these technical ambitions in mind, I'm interested to see how far I can advance as a frontend developer and migrate to full stack development.
